## Features and How to Use

My friends and I love talking about skincare and sharing our favorite (and least favorite) products with each other. This is the idea behind "Like That" to have a place where we can share products we are using and add our thoughts and reviews to it as well. The product page is simple with an image, Title, description, and price so users know what to expect if they want to buy it for themselves. 

When a user reaches the site they will have full visibilty to the products and reviews- no gatekeeping!! Once signed up and logged in a user can then add new comments to any product, edit/delete their comments, and add new products to the site to be reviewed. 

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Render account
- Postgresql
